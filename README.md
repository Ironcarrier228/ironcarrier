# ironcarrier

## Overview

`ironcarrier` is a lightweight, modular framework for building network attack vectors and a core engine to run them. The repository is organized as a **monorepo** containing two main components:

1. **core** – The engine, configuration, logging, and statistics modules that drive vector execution.
2. **vectors** – A collection of ready‑to‑use attack vector implementations, split into two categories:
   - **amplification** – Protocol‑level amplification attacks (e.g., DNS, NTP, SSDP, Memcached, CHARGEN, CLDAP, etc.).
   - **layer7** – Application‑layer (HTTP) attacks such as slowloris, slow‑post, HTTP flood, bypass, hammer, and rage.

The project is intentionally minimal with no external build system; each Python module can be imported and used directly or executed via the `core/init.py` entry point.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (the code uses type hints and f‑strings).
- No additional third‑party dependencies; the core modules rely only on the Python standard library.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the package in editable mode if you want to develop against it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ironcarrier/ironcarrier.git
cd ironcarrier
pip install -e .  # optional – creates an editable install
```

> **Note**: The repository does not contain a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`. For simple usage you can add the repository root to `PYTHONPATH`:
>
> ```bash
> export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
> ```

### Running a Vector

Each vector can be imported and executed via the core engine. Below is an example of running the DNS amplification vector:

```python
from core.engine import Engine
from vectors.amplification.dns_amp import DNSAmplificationVector

engine = Engine()
engine.add_vector(DNSAmplificationVector())
engine.run()
```

Replace `DNSAmplificationVector` with any other vector class from `vectors/amplification` or `vectors/layer7`.

## Core Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `config.py` | Loads and validates configuration files (JSON/YAML). |
| `engine.py` | Orchestrates vector execution, concurrency, and result collection. |
| `init.py` | Provides a simple CLI (`python -m core.init`) for quick tests. |
| `logger.py` | Centralised, JSON‑line logging with timestamps and severity levels. |
| `stats.py` | Aggregates packet/response statistics for reporting.

---

## Adding New Vectors

1. Create a new Python file under the appropriate sub‑directory (`amplification` or `layer7`).
2. Subclass `core.engine.BaseVector` (or follow the pattern of existing vectors) and implement the required `run(self, target)` method.
3. Register the vector in `vectors/<category>/__init__.py` if you want it automatically discoverable.
4. Update any documentation and optionally add unit tests under a `tests/` folder.
